1. Scrum might be the best here since we have a wide variety of skill sets on the team. We got everyone from seasoned developers to interns. Having well defined roles might be more clear for everyone involved. Scrum can also push out products quickly, which will help when we’re working with another team.  
2. An incremental model might be best in this situation. We can push out a fully functional model right away, and continue to add more features as needed. In phase 1, we can make the site fully functional, and all the extra features can be added down the line.  
3. Spiral model would be best. With high emphasis on risk and the software working the first time, spiral would be the best model. With risk being accounted for in every step of the way, it makes sense to use spiral as we don’t want the power plant to blow up.  
4. Waterfall is best here since we don’t need to update the product. We make it right once, and the product is done. Waterfall is also really consistent. We can set time frames for each stage, so we can hit the deadline right on time.  
5. Incremental model would be best here. We know the general requirements product at the very beginning, so it won’t be very hard to push out a fully functional product. However, the products might need updates or will change down the line, so an incremental model would allow us to update it. Otherwise a waterfall model would be the best choice.  
6. Scrum is the best choice in my opinion. We can push out products fast, but as new information or requirements come in, we can update accordingly. With such a small team, teamwork would be very crucial.  
7. Incremental model would be the best in my opinion. Since we have a solid small team of developers, they can push out an initial product. As the team hires more people, they can join in at later stages. If they receive further grants, the team can also use the money in later stages.

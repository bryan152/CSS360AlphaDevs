#1:  New e-Commerce site
(integration and configuration model): since we’re going to use the resources and inner model we already have, and it’s only required to 
make change a little bit, that is fit with integration and configuration model


#2： Dental office site
(Incremental development model): as dentist said, this website needs uopdate frequent, this means we need often update or software, the best
part of Incremental development model is easy handling the demand changes, and keep update.


#3: Nuclear Power Plant
（Waterfall model）：We need to develop stable and robust software. If the development takes longer, it indicates fewer necessary updates in the future and 
greater long-term stability. Therefore, the Waterfall model aligns best with our goals


#4: Department of Transportation
（Intergration and configuration）：We have a substantial team, and the company has extensive experience developing similar solutions in the transportation sector. Therefore, 
we can effectively leverage existing resources to complete the project.

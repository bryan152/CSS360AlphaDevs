#1:  New e-Commerce site
(integration and configuration model): since we’re going to use the resources and inner model we already have, and it’s only required to 
make change a little bit, that is fit with integration and configuration model


#2： Dental office site
(Incremental development model): as dentist said, this website needs uopdate frequent, this means we need often update or software, the best
part of Incremental development model is easy handling the demand changes, and keep update.

## #1:  New e-Commerce site
(integration and configuration model): since we’re going to use the resources and inner model we already have, and it’s only required to 
make change a little bit, that is fit with integration and configuration model


## #2： Dental office site
(Incremental development model): as dentist said, this website needs uopdate frequent, this means we need often update or software, the best
part of Incremental development model is easy handling the demand changes, and keep update.


## #3: Nuclear Power Plant
（Waterfall model）：We need to develop stable and robust software. If the development takes longer, it indicates fewer necessary updates in the 
future and greater long-term stability. Therefore, the Waterfall model aligns best with our goals


## #4: Department of Transportation
（Intergration and configuration）：We have a substantial team, and the company has extensive experience developing similar solutions in the 
transportation sector. Therefore, we can effectively leverage existing resources to complete the project.


## #5: Reducing Traffic
(incremental development model): this software will be able to provide real-time traffic updates on digital billboards along the roads, so that 
mean is should be update in every mins or secs, it’s fit with the characteristic of incremental development model


## #6: Educational game
(Agile Model): Agile emphasizes short development cycles—such as one Sprint every two weeks—and rapid delivery of functional components. It's 
well-suited for scenarios where early online testing is essential. Agile also allows flexible adjustments to the development plan as customer 
requirements evolve. This model enables my small team to adapt quickly, respond to user needs efficiently, and effectively integrate market 
and user feedback into the development process.


## #7: Global Health
(Spiral Model）： Due to the project's high risk and uncertainty, along with the need for gradual investment, the Spiral model is a suitable choice. 
It allows us to define goals and requirements iteratively, making it ideal for innovative projects with limited initial resources and significant 
uncertainties and risks.

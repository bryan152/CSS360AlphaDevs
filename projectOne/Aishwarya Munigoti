### #1: New e-Commerce site

The incremental model would be the most appropriate for this project, because for every new template or scripting extension proposed, a new set of requirements
and team need to be created. This mirrors how in the incremental model, there can be any number of phases, and each phase includes the entire process of the
waterfall model within it. This project is also in the category of projects that the incremental model is often used with, products where feature updates are
expected often and products that are usable consistently. 

### #2: Dental office site
Your good friend, a dentist, asks you to develop a web site for their new clinic. The web site should include common information about the clinic like hours, location, dental staff, and downloadable forms.  At some point in the future, they would like to include an ability to make online appointments, send automated reminders via text messages, and issue discounts. Your friend is flexible with the time when you will deliver software.  They also wish to continually add capabilities to the website in order to draw more patients to their clinic.

The spiral model would be the most appropriate for this project 

### #3: Nuclear Power Plant
The waterfall model would be the most appropriate for this project as this project would be classified as a critical product, and there is a final end product. 
As the software is expected to last for 10 years and has high stakes to perform its job properly, it would be considered a critical system, and would thus need
to be developed in clearly defined phases with clear specifications and requirements fulfilled before moving onto the next phase. 

### #4: Department of Transportation
Your company won the contract to develop a distributed application which stores data on the Cloud.  This is in response to a thorough 100 page specifications from the Department of Transportation. The specifications is very detailed in whatâ€™s expected from the application. 

 Your company has developed similar solutions in the transportation domain on numerous previous occasions, and you have the appropriate experienced staff for the project. You bid on the project to be completed within 18 months based on a team of 10 software engineers.

### #5: Reducing Traffic


### #6: Educational game
The extreme programming model would be the most appropriate for this project as the developers would need to work closely with the customer and the requirements change quickly with new sets of requirements added. As extreme programming does not have formal specifications with rapidly changing requirements, this would work well with the games needed to be delivered ASAP. Also the games would need to be developed quickly so testing would need to be done at the same time as writing the code, to have games out quickly.

### #7: Global Health
The waterfall model would be the most appropriate for this project as the software needing to be developed is critical and has broad repurcussions, and there is a clear development phase defined as well. The software would have a positive impact on the health of people residing in developing countries, so it would need to be developed with clear phases and it being signed off for each phase. With a clearly defined development phase as well, it would not fit more agile methods with no strict phases defined. Also, the team working on the project may grow, and waterfall models work well with large teams who need clearly defined phases.

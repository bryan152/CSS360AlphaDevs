## #1: New e-Commerce site

The incremental model would be the most appropriate for this project, because for every new template or scripting extension proposed, a new set of requirements
and team need to be created. This mirrors how in the incremental model, there can be any number of phases, and each phase includes the entire process of the
waterfall model within it. This project is also in the category of projects that the incremental model is often used with, products where feature updates are
expected often and products that are usable consistently. 

## #2: Dental office site
Your good friend, a dentist, asks you to develop a web site for their new clinic. The web site should include common information about the clinic like hours, location, dental staff, and downloadable forms.  At some point in the future, they would like to include an ability to make online appointments, send automated reminders via text messages, and issue discounts. Your friend is flexible with the time when you will deliver software.  They also wish to continually add capabilities to the website in order to draw more patients to their clinic.

The spiral model would be the most appropriate for this project 

## #3: Nuclear Power Plant
The waterfall model would be the most appropriate for this project as this project would be classified as a critical product, and there is a final end product. 
As the software is expected to last for 10 years and has high stakes to perform its job properly, it would be considered a critical system, and would thus need
to be developed in clearly defined phases with clear specifications and requirements fulfilled before moving onto the next phase.

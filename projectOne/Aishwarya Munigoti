The incremental model would be the most appropriate for this project, because for every new template or scripting extension proposed, a new set of requirements
and team need to be created. This mirrors how in the incremental model, there can be any number of phases, and each phase includes the entire process of the
waterfall model within it. This project is also in the category of projects that the incremental model is often used with, products where feature updates are
expected often and products that are usable consistently.

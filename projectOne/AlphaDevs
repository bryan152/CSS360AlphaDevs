# Whole Team Decision

## #1: New e-Commerce site
1. > First Choice
>> The SDLC model we thought was most appropriate for this project is the integration and configuration model. We thought this model was most appropriate because as the company already has website templates that can be reconfigured to meet the customer's requests. Our manager also wants the company to use the same tools we have used in the past. We are reusing software models that were already implemented in this case, which is a key aspect in the integration model. As this model relies on reusing older software and modifying it, this would fit in well with the company manager's request and use our existing website frameworks. 
2. > Secondary choices 
> Our teams second choice for this scenerio was a tie between incremental and agile. Both are somewhat on the oposite sides when it comes to methods but would cause issues. agile would be too quick and cause errors while incremental might take too long and upset customers.


## #2: Dental office site
1. > First Choice
>> The SDLC model we thought was most appropriate for this project is the incremental model. We thought this model was the most appropriate because we will need to continuously add new features to the website, and this fits in with how in the incremental model, we can release smaller versions of the product at the end of each phase. Also in the incremental model, we can have as many phases as need to develop our product, fitting in with our dentist friend being flexible with when we can deliver the software. The incremental model will allow us to continually release updates to the website, and receive feedback from our friend easily.
2. > Secondary choices 
>> This scenerio had no second choice. we all agreed and voted for the incremental approach.

## #3: Nuclear Power Plant
1. > First Choice
>> The SDLC model we thought was most appropriate for this project is the waterfall model. We thought this model was the most appropriate because of it being a critical software and the time it needs to last (10 years). As the software would have an important role as it oversees nuclear power plants, and would thus need to be carefully implemented as to avoid safety-related problems. 
2. > Secondary choices 
>> This scenerio was a strong candidate for waterfall, gaining 4 votes and only 1 vote for a spiral method. while a spiral method could be applied, we decided that safety is the most important and therefor take one step at a time.

## #4: Department of Transportation
1. > First Choice
>> The SDLC model we thought was most appropriate for this project is the  model. We thought this model was the most appropriate because 
2. > Secondary choices 
>> this was very close between waterfall and intergration but waterfall ended up being second place. while waterfall would also work, we tought it was best that the customer see results more often and work towards adding new features.

## #5: Reducing Traffic
1. > First Choice
>> The SDLC model we thought was most appropriate for this project is the incremental model. We thought this model was the most appropriate because 
2. > Secondary choices 
>> Waterfall was our second choice due to the "straight-forwardness" when it comes to planning this project but it might have taken longer that incremental.

## #6: Educational game
1. > First Choice
>> The SDLC model we thought was most appropriate for this project is the extreme programming model. We thought this model was the most appropriate because 
2. > Secondary choices 
>> This one did not have any votes for any secondary choices. We all agreed that an agile/extreme method would work best.

## #7: Global Health
1. > First Choice
>> The SDLC model we thought was most appropriate for this project is the incremental model. We thought this model was the most appropriate because 
2. > Secondary choices 
>> Waterall was our second choice. the argument for this was due to the importance around acurracy. By making sure each step is correct before moving on, this accuracy would be achieved.

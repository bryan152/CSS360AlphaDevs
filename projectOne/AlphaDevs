# Whole Team Decision

## #1: New e-Commerce site
1. > First Choice
>> 
2. > Secondary choices 
> Our teams second choice for this scenerio was a tie between incremental and agile. Both are somewhat on the oposite sides when it comes to methods but would cause issues. agile would be too quick and cause errors while incremental might take too long and upset customers.


## #2: Dental office site
1. > First Choice
>> 
2. > Secondary choices 
>> This scenerio had no second choice. we all agreed and voted for the incremental approach.

## #3: Nuclear Power Plant
1. > First Choice
>> 
2. > Secondary choices 
>> This scenerio was a strong candidate for waterfall, gaining 4 votes and only 1 vote for a spiral method. while a spiral method could be applied, we decided that safety is the most important and therefor take one step at a time.

## #4: Department of Transportation
1. > First Choice
>> 
2. > Secondary choices 
>> this was very close between waterfall and intergration but waterfall ended up being second place. while waterfall would also work, we tought it was best that the customer see results more often and work towards adding new features.

## #5: Reducing Traffic
1. > First Choice
>> 
2. > Secondary choices 
>> Waterfall was our second choice due to the "straight-forwardness" when it comes to planning this project but it might have taken longer that incremental.

## #6: Educational game
1. > First Choice
>> 
2. > Secondary choices 
>> This one did not have any votes for any secondary choices. We all agreed that an agile/extreme method would work best.

## #7: Global Health
1. > First Choice
>> 
2. > Secondary choices 
>> Waterall was our second choice. the argument for this was due to the importance around acurracy. By making sure each step is correct before moving on, this accuracy would be achieved.
